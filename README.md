# Portable Text Editor

This is a lightweight browser based text editor that's helpful for quick and easy text manipulation. Originally written to automate repetitive changes to text in environments where a more full featured editor like Notepad++ or Atom is unavailable.

A common use case is formatting a long list of words (variables, column names, etc.) for use in source code.
